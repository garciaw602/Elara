# 🎮 Elara – Game Jam Project

**Elara** is a first-person narrative puzzle game developed during a Game Jam using Unity. Set in a surreal, emotional world, the player navigates through memories and illusions after a heartbreak. The game explores themes of love, loss, and mental collapse.

## 🧠 Concept

> *“A psychedelic journey through the shattered mind of lost love.”*

You play as someone caught in an emotional spiral, walking through distorted memories and dreamlike environments. Solve puzzles, piece together meaning, and find your way through the emotional chaos.

📖 Synopsis
In the year 2040, the world lies in ruins after the outbreak of the Elara-X virus. When Gabriel returns home, he finds his city destroyed, his family missing, and the dead walking—some with memories they should no longer have. As he uncovers audio logs from his wife Elena, a renowned geneticist, Gabriel must face the ultimate moral decision.
