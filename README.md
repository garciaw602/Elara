# 🎮 Elara – Game Jam Project

**Elara** is a first-person narrative puzzle game developed during a Game Jam using Unity. Set in a surreal, emotional world, the player navigates through memories and illusions after a heartbreak. The game explores themes of love, loss, and mental collapse.

## 🧠 Concept
